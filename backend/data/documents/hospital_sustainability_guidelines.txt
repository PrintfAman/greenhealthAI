GreenHealth Reference Guidelines

ICU medical waste reduction:
- Segregate waste at point of care: infectious, sharps, pharmaceutical, recyclable.
- Use color-coded bins with clear labels and daily compliance checks.
- Shift from single-use kits to procedure-specific kits to reduce over-opening.
- Introduce reusable gowns, drapes, and sterilizable instrument trays where clinically safe.
- Track waste per occupied ICU bed and review weekly with nursing leadership.

Energy efficiency in critical care:
- Set ICU HVAC and lighting schedules around occupancy and clinical constraints.
- Replace legacy monitors and pumps with energy-efficient models during refresh cycles.
- Enable automatic sleep mode for non-clinical workstations and display panels.
- Audit compressed air and oxygen leak losses quarterly.

Paper and digital workflow:
- Default printers to duplex and black-and-white.
- Digitize consent forms and discharge packets using EHR-integrated templates.
- Review print logs per department and set monthly reduction targets.

Governance and alerts:
- Trigger high-severity alert when ICU waste rises above 40 kg average over 15 minutes.
- Trigger medium-severity alert when energy exceeds 200 kWh average over 15 minutes.
- Escalate unresolved alerts older than 30 minutes to operations manager.

KPI targets:
- Reduce ICU waste intensity by 15 percent in 90 days.
- Reduce facility energy intensity by 10 percent in 6 months.
- Reduce paper usage by 25 percent in 6 months.
